Initiative tracking in d20 games can be quite a burden especially when there are
many characters to keep track of.

This set of tools is designed to make that easier for the DM/GM. As a bonus, players
also get a tool to track their HP. In the days before there were electronic character
sheets, tracking HP was a lot of erasing and rewriting the current HP on one's
character sheet.

## Components

- **Player App**: An application that facilitates easy tracking of HP amongst other stats.
- **DM/GM App**: This application allows for easy tracking of initiative (and other things).
